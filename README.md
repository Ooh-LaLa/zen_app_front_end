### üçÉ Welcome to Zen Quote App. Here, you will find little droplets of zen left by people who are practicing the art of mindfulness. Zen involves the contemplation of koans - riddles or paradoxes that are used to challenge the mind and break through conceptual thinking.    

### Use this app to share some zen thoughts with fellow practitioners aiming to cultivate awareness and attentiveness in their lives. This app intends to bring its users closer to achieving a state of mind free from ego, attachment and judgment, which leads to a path of greater insight, compassion and wisdom. Namaste. üçÉ
